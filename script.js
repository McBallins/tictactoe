  we have 9 lactions
  each location has three possible states- x, o, null
  each location can be an Object

  check to see if the location is available
  store an object that saves the new state of the location
  write x or o into the corresponding location
  when three xs or os are place in a row, one player wins
  if the board is full and there is not a row of xs or os, tie
